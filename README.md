This repository contains the report and accompanying code (provided at the end of the file) developed for a Project in the scope of the course "Numerical optimization for large scale problems and Stochastic Optimization" at the Polytechnic University of Turin.
The project focuses on exploring unconstrained optimization methods through the implementation and testing of two algorithms: the **Modified Newton method** and the **Modified Newton method with Finite Differences**.
The primary objective is to compare these algorithms and evaluate their performance across different scenarios by applying them to various optimizationÂ problems.

**Team**: Annalisa Belloni; Valeria Petrianni.
